## üìã Action Items (In Order)

### Phase 1: Backend Deployment (2-3 hours)

#### Step 1: Secure the Backend
```bash
cd backend

# 1. Generate strong JWT secret
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"

# 2. Update .env with the generated secret
# Replace JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret... with the generated value

# 3. Remove .env from git if it's tracked
git rm --cached .env
git commit -m "Remove .env from version control"
```

#### Step 2: Set Up Database
Choose one:
- **Railway** (easiest): Create PostgreSQL database in dashboard
- **Supabase** (free): Create project at supabase.com
- **Neon** (serverless): Create project at neon.tech

```bash
# Connect and initialize schema
psql "your-production-database-url"
\i database-schema.sql
\dt  # Verify tables
\q
```

#### Step 3: Deploy Backend
Choose one platform:

**Option A: Railway (Recommended for beginners)**
1. Go to railway.app
2. Create new project from GitHub repo
3. Select backend folder
4. Add PostgreSQL database
5. Set environment variables (JWT_SECRET, NODE_ENV=production)
6. Deploy automatically

**Option B: Vercel**
```bash
cd backend
npm run build
vercel login
vercel --prod

# Set environment variables
vercel env add DATABASE_URL
vercel env add JWT_SECRET
vercel env add NODE_ENV production
```

#### Step 4: Test Backend
```bash
# Replace with your actual API URL
export API_URL="https://your-api-url.com"

# Test health
curl $API_URL/health

# Test registration
curl -X POST $API_URL/api/users/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@test.com","password":"Test123!","username":"testuser"}'

# Test login
curl -X POST $API_URL/api/users/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@test.com","password":"Test123!"}'
```

### Phase 2: Android App Configuration (1-2 hours)

#### Step 5: Update API Configuration
```kotlin
// File: app/src/main/java/com/example/pitpulseandroid/data/network/ApiConfig.kt
// Line 7: Update PROD_BASE_URL with your deployed backend URL

private const val PROD_BASE_URL = "https://your-api-url.com/api/"
```

#### Step 6: Change Package Name (IMPORTANT!)
**‚ö†Ô∏è MUST DO THIS BEFORE FIRST PLAY STORE UPLOAD!**

Follow instructions in `PACKAGE_NAME_CHANGE.md`:
1. Open project in Android Studio
2. Refactor package from `com.example.pitpulseandroid` to `com.pitpulse.android`
3. Update `applicationId` in `app/build.gradle.kts`
4. Clean and rebuild

#### Step 7: Generate Release Keystore
Follow instructions in `KEYSTORE_SETUP.md`:

```bash
# In project root
keytool -genkey -v -keystore pitpulse-release-key.keystore \
  -alias pitpulse \
  -keyalg RSA \
  -keysize 2048 \
  -validity 10000

# Create keystore.properties
echo "storePassword=YOUR_PASSWORD" > keystore.properties
echo "keyPassword=YOUR_PASSWORD" >> keystore.properties
echo "keyAlias=pitpulse" >> keystore.properties
echo "storeFile=pitpulse-release-key.keystore" >> keystore.properties
```

**IMPORTANT:** Save your passwords securely! You cannot recover them!

#### Step 8: Build and Test
```bash
# Sync Gradle files (for new dependencies)
./gradlew --refresh-dependencies

# Test debug build
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Install on device and test
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

# Test key features:
# - App launches
# - Can register new user
# - Can login
# - Can view venues
