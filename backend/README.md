Protected endpoints require a valid JWT token. Tokens expire after 7 days by default.

## 🚦 Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse:
- **Authentication endpoints**: 5 requests per 15 minutes
- **General endpoints**: 30-100 requests per 15 minutes  
- **Badge checking**: 10 requests per 15 minutes

Users automatically earn badges based on their activity:
- **First Check-in** - Check in to your first show
- **Check-in Champion** - Check in to 10 shows
- **Check-in Legend** - Check in to 50 shows
- **Venue Explorer** - Check in at 5 different venues
