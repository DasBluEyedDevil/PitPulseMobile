## Technical Decisions

### Why Riverpod?
- Type-safe and compile-time checked
- Better than Provider for complex apps
- Excellent for dependency injection
- Works well with code generation
- Great testing support

### Why GoRouter?
- Declarative routing (Flutter's future)
- Deep linking support
- Type-safe navigation
- Auth-based redirects out of the box
- Web support ready

### Why Freezed?
- Immutable models by default
- Generates boilerplate (copyWith, equality, etc.)
- Works seamlessly with json_serializable
- Union types support
- Better than manual implementation

### Why Dio?
- Powerful HTTP client for Flutter
- Built-in interceptors
- Request/response transformation
- Better error handling than http package
- FormData support for file uploads

## Migration from React Native

This Flutter app replicates all functionality from the React Native PitPulse app:

| React Native Feature | Flutter Equivalent | Status |
|---------------------|-------------------|--------|
| Redux Toolkit | Riverpod | ✅ |
| React Navigation | GoRouter | ✅ |
| Axios | Dio | ✅ |
| AsyncStorage | flutter_secure_storage | ✅ |
| React Native Components | Material Widgets | ✅ |
| StyleSheet | ThemeData | ✅ |
| Expo | Flutter SDK | ✅ |

## Known Issues

1. **Code Generation Required**: All .freezed.dart and .g.dart files need to be generated using build_runner
2. **Backend Dependency**: App requires running backend server to function
3. **No Offline Support**: Currently requires network connection for all operations
4. **Limited Error Messages**: Some error messages need more user-friendly formatting

## Next Release Goals

### Version 0.2.0
- Complete search functionality
- Add filtering and sorting
- Display reviews on detail screens
- Implement image upload
- Add unit tests for repositories
- Add widget tests for critical screens

### Version 0.3.0
- Location services integration
- Nearby venues feature
- Push notifications
- Dark mode support
- Improve error handling
- Add integration tests

### Version 1.0.0 (Production Ready)
- Complete test coverage
- Performance optimization
- Offline mode
- Analytics
- Crash reporting
- App store deployment
- Documentation completion
