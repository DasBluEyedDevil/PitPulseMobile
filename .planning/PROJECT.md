# SoundCheck

## What This Is

SoundCheck is the "Untappd of live music" — a social concert check-in app for concertgoers. Users check in at shows, rate both the band's performance and the venue experience, earn badges for their concert habits, and see what shows their friends are attending in real-time. It turns going to concerts into a social, gamified experience with a persistent concert resume that showcases your live music identity.

## Core Value

The live check-in moment: a user at a show can check in fast, rate what they're experiencing, and share it with friends — and that single action feeds discovery, social proof, gamification, and their concert identity.

### Active

**Future**
- [ ] Collaborative filtering for recommendations
- [ ] WebSocket horizontal scaling (multi-instance)
- [ ] Public API with OAuth2 scopes
- [ ] Venue owner dashboard / B2B tools
- [ ] Web presence for SEO/sharing

### Out of Scope

- Web frontend — mobile-only; no web profiles or web app for v1
- Past concert logging/diary — "I'm here now" creates urgency and authenticity
- Ticket sales or purchasing — link out to Ticketmaster/Bandsintown
- Live streaming or audio features — about being there, not watching remotely
- Chat/messaging between users — social via check-ins, toasts, comments
- Concert buddy matching — safety concerns, moderation complexity
- Competitive leaderboards/rankings — badges reward milestones, not competition

## Context

**Current State (v3.0 shipped 2026-03-01):**
- Monorepo: `/backend` (Node.js/Express/TypeScript) and `/mobile` (Flutter/Dart)
- PostgreSQL with 39 migrations, Redis caching, BullMQ job processing
- Clean architecture on mobile (data/domain/presentation), MVC + service layer on backend
- Deployed on Railway.app (single instance)
- External integrations: Ticketmaster, Foursquare, MusicBrainz, SetlistFM, Firebase, Cloudflare R2, Sentry, RevenueCat, Resend (email), Cloud Vision SafeSearch
- Full trust & safety pipeline (report/block/moderation/verification)
- SoundCheck Wrapped + Pro subscription tier
- User discovery (search + suggestions) and global feed
- Structured winston logging with Sentry error tracking
- Smoke tests, deployment runbook, CI with gitleaks

**Remaining Technical Debt:** *(updated 2026-03-14 after v4.0)*
- ~~Legacy `reviews` table coexists with `checkin_band_ratings`~~ → RESOLVED (v4.0 Phase 26)
- ~~686 hardcoded AppTheme.*Dark color references~~ → RESOLVED (v4.0 Phase 24)
- ~~10 pre-existing test failures~~ → RESOLVED (v4.0 Phase 23)
- ~~Legacy createCheckin(bandId+venueId) path~~ → RESOLVED (v4.0 Phase 25)
- CheckinService still ~600 LOC after legacy removal (facade pattern, extraction deferred)
- 3 production env vars still open (OPS-02 — Resend [deferred on DNS], Google OAuth, Apple Developer). 10/13 configured 2026-04-19.
- ~~Mobile Firebase configs still placeholder~~ → RESOLVED 2026-04-19 (flutterfire configure against `soundcheck-prod-e973c`, commit dfab264)
- No mobile screen for claimed owner stats or band profile edit
- No load testing or horizontal scaling
- `checkin_providers.dart` + `checkin_screen.dart` reference removed `createCheckIn()` method

**Shipped Milestones:**
- v1.0 MVP (2026-02-27): 8 phases, 22 plans, 77 requirements
- v1.1 Launch Readiness (2026-02-28): 9 phases, 30 plans, 32 requirements
- v2.0 Beta Launch (2026-03-01): 5 phases, 10 plans, 28 requirements
- v3.0 UI/UX Design Audit (2026-03-01): 4 phases, 9 plans, 33 requirements
- v4.0 Technical Consolidation (2026-03-13): 6 phases, 8 plans, 9 requirements

**Active Milestone:** None — all milestones shipped. OPS-02 (provider accounts) carry-forward.

## Constraints

- **Tech Stack**: Flutter 3.27.4+ (mobile), Node.js 20 / Express / TypeScript (backend), PostgreSQL 12+ — continue existing stack
- **Platform**: Mobile only (iOS + Android via Flutter)
- **External APIs**: Ticketmaster (primary), Foursquare, MusicBrainz, SetlistFM, Firebase, Cloudflare R2
- **Deployment**: Railway.app (backend), App Store / Google Play (mobile)
- **Quality Bar**: App Store approved, production-grade

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Rebuild on existing stack (not rewrite) | Flutter + Node/Express/PostgreSQL stack is solid; problem was features, not technology | ✓ Good — 22 plans in 2.3 hours |
| Events as first-class entities with lineups | A show is the atomic unit — one event, multiple bands, per-set ratings | ✓ Good — clean data model |
| Dual ratings (band + venue) | Independent signals; conflating them loses useful data | ✓ Good — works well |
| Ticketmaster as primary event source | Songkick dead, Bandsintown needs approval | ✓ Good — reliable pipeline |
| BullMQ for async processing | Badge eval, event sync, notification batching need background jobs | ✓ Good — survives deploys |
| Expand-contract migration | Backward compat during schema transition | ✓ Good — zero downtime |
| Mobile only for v1 | Check-in-at-a-show is inherently mobile | ⚠️ Revisit — web needed for SEO/sharing |
| No B2B venue tools for v1 | Consumer first | ⚠️ Revisit — venue accounts needed for growth |
| Live check-in only (no retroactive) | "I'm here now" creates urgency | ✓ Good — core differentiator |
| Presigned URL photo upload | Client PUTs directly to R2, no Railway proxy | ✓ Good — fast, scalable |
| Redis Pub/Sub for WebSocket fan-out | Foundation for horizontal scaling | ✓ Good — architecture ready |
| JSONB badge criteria | New badges without code changes | ✓ Good — 37 badges, zero custom code per type |
