3. **Phone screenshots** section
4. **Add** → Upload 4-6 screenshots
5. **Drag to reorder** (first screenshot is most important)

---

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

### Tip 1: Use Light Mode
Light screenshots typically look better in Play Store thumbnails (white background). If your app supports dark mode, consider light mode for screenshots.

### Tip 2: Show Real Content
Use actual venue names from your seed data (Madison Square Garden, Red Rocks, House of Blues). It looks more legitimate than "Test Venue 1, Test Venue 2".

### Tip 3: Tell a Story
Your 4-6 screenshots should tell a narrative:
1. "Here's what the app does" (venues list)
2. "Here's how deep the content is" (venue detail)
3. "Here's another way to explore" (bands)
4. "Here's what makes it engaging" (badges)

### Tip 4: Test on Play Store Preview
Before submitting, view your screenshots in:
- Search results (small thumbnail)
- Store listing (gallery view)
- Tablet view (landscape orientation)

### Tip 5: Update Regularly
Plan to update screenshots when you:
- Add major features
- Redesign UI
- Get better content (real venue photos)
- Approach public launch
