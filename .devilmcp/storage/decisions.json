    "rationale": "After thorough analysis using DevilMCP project structure analysis, file inspection, and backend health checks, I have identified critical gaps and completed items. Need to provide actionable roadmap prioritized by criticality.",

      "backend_status": "deployed and live on Railway",

    "outcome": "Successfully completed comprehensive beta-readiness preparation",
    "actual_impact": "All 3 critical blockers resolved plus iOS platform added, database configured, release APK built, and comprehensive documentation created. Project reduced from 6-8 hours to beta to 3-8 hours remaining (mainly assets and store submission).",
    "lessons_learned": "1. Using DevilMCP for tracking decisions and changes provided excellent documentation trail. 2. Creating comprehensive guides (keystore, testing, screenshots) upfront saves time later. 3. ProGuard configuration needs careful attention for Flutter apps with Play Core dependencies. 4. Railway internal URLs don't work from local - need public proxy endpoint. 5. Building systematically (config \u2192 test \u2192 document) is more efficient than ad-hoc approach.",
