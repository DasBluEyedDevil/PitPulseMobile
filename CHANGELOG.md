### Previous: API Integration Design
**Date**: 2025-11-13 (API Integration Design Complete)
**Task**: Designed complete API integration system for "Untappd for Live Music" experience
**Status**: Completed ✅
**What was designed**:
- Events-based check-in model (venue + band + date as core entity)
- Foursquare Places API integration for venue discovery
- MusicBrainz API integration for band/artist data
- Dual rating system (separate venue and band ratings)
- Social features (activity feed, toasts, comments, friends)
- 5-tab navigation (Activity, Venues, Discover, Map, Profile)
- Floating Action Button for check-ins
- Hybrid data approach (external APIs + user contributions)

**APIs Configured**:
- ✅ Foursquare API key added to .env ($200/month free credits)
- ✅ MusicBrainz user-agent configured (100% free)

**Design Document**: `docs/plans/2025-11-13-api-integration-design.md`

**Previous Task** (Same Day - Database Seed Data):
**Task**: Added seed data script to populate app with realistic venues and bands
**Status**: Completed ✅ (Database populated with test data)
**What was added**:
- Created comprehensive seed script (`backend/src/scripts/seed.ts`)
- Added 15 realistic venues across major US cities (The Fillmore, Red Rocks, Brooklyn Steel, etc.)
- Added 20 diverse bands across multiple genres (Rock, Electronic, Jazz, Metal, Hip Hop, etc.)
- Added 5 sample reviews to demonstrate rating system
- Created npm scripts: `npm run seed` and `npm run seed:dev`

**Database Content**:
- ✅ 15 venues with real addresses, coordinates, capacities, and images
- ✅ 20 bands with descriptions, genres, formed years, and hometowns
- ✅ 5 sample reviews with ratings and detailed content
- ✅ Automatic rating calculations for venues and bands

**Previous Task** (Same Day - Auth Response Parsing):
**Task**: Fixed login/register flow to parse Railway API response wrapper
**Status**: Completed ✅ (Authentication fully working)
**Fix**: Updated auth_repository.dart to extract nested `data` object from API wrapper

**Previous Task** (Same Day - Critical Router Fix):
**Task**: Fixed app crash on launch due to router error handling
**Status**: Completed ✅ (Router crash resolved)
**Root Cause**: Router was accessing `authState.value` without checking if state had an error first
**Fix Applied**: Changed to `authState.hasValue && authState.value != null` in app_router.dart line 29

**Previous Fix** (Same Day):
**Task**: Fixed button rendering issue in login/register screens
**Status**: Completed ✅
**Fix**: Removed `const` from conditional button children to fix widget tree rebuilding

**Previous Task** (Same Day):
**Date**: 2025-11-13
**Task**: IDE configuration fix - Enable monorepo support in Android Studio
**Status**: Completed ✅ (Dart facet configured, matching NoBSDating structure)
**Changes**:
- Added Dart facet to `.idea/PitPulse.iml` for Flutter recognition
- Created `.idea/libraries.xml` with Dart SDK and Dart Packages libraries
- Updated library order entries in module configuration
- Project now works at monorepo root, just like NoBSDating
- **User can now edit backend AND mobile files in one IDE window**

**Previous Task** (Same Day):
**Task**: Legal documentation and beta-readiness verification
**Status**: Completed ✅ (Legal documents created, builds verified)
**Changes**: Created PRIVACY_POLICY.md and TERMS_OF_SERVICE.md for Play Store compliance
**Build Status**:
- ✅ Android APK: 52 MB (ready for device testing)
- ✅ Android AAB: 43 MB (ready for Play Store submission)
- ✅ iOS platform: Fully configured (requires macOS to build)

**Multi-Platform Status**:
- PitPulse IS multi-platform configured (Android + iOS)
- Both platforms are 100% ready for builds
- iOS requires Mac/Xcode (standard Flutter requirement)
- Not a project limitation—it's a build environment requirement

**Next Steps** (Requires User Action):
1. Test Release APK on Android device (install app-release.apk from mobile/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/)
2. Create app icon (512x512 PNG, see docs/APP_ICON_DESIGN_GUIDE.md)
3. Capture 4-6 screenshots (see docs/SCREENSHOT_GUIDE.md)
4. Host PRIVACY_POLICY.md publicly (GitHub Pages or website)
5. Backup keystore to secure locations (see mobile/KEYSTORE_BACKUP_INFO.txt)
6. Create Google Play Developer Account ($25 registration)
7. Upload AAB to Play Store with icon/screenshots/descriptions
8. Access Mac to build iOS version (platform already configured)

**Previous Session Summary**:
**Date**: 2025-11-13 (Initial Beta Prep)
**Task**: Prepared PitPulse Flutter app for beta release
**Status**: Completed ✅ (All critical blockers resolved)
**Changes**: Android permissions, package rename, iOS platform setup, signing config, backend .env, beta checklist
**Details**:
- Resolved all 3 critical blockers identified in beta-readiness review
- iOS support now fully configured (was missing entirely)
- Updated outdated Android/Kotlin checklist to Flutter-specific version
- Backend is live at https://pitpulsemobile-production.up.railway.app/api
- Mobile app configured to use production backend
- Comprehensive documentation created for remaining tasks

### Fixed - 2025-11-07
- **Railway Deployment Build Issue**: Fixed TypeScript compilation error during Railway/Nixpacks deployment
  - Added `nixpacks.toml` in repository root to configure monorepo structure
  - Configured Nixpacks to properly navigate to the `backend/` subdirectory for build and start commands
  - Updated `backend/tsconfig.json` to exclude test files from production builds
  - Build now successfully compiles TypeScript files to `dist/` directory
  - **Root Cause**: Nixpacks was running build commands at repository root instead of backend subdirectory
  - **Solution**: Configured build phases to use `cd backend &&` for install, build, and start commands

### Technical Details
- Created `nixpacks.toml` with proper phase configuration:
  - Install phase: `cd backend && npm ci --production=false`
  - Build phase: `cd backend && npm run build`
  - Start command: `cd backend && npm start`
- Updated TypeScript exclude list to prevent test files from being compiled in production

## Most Recent Task
**Date**: 2025-11-07
**Task**: Fixed Railway deployment build failure (caused by Flutter migration project restructuring)
**Status**: Completed ✅ (GitHub deployments working)
**Commits**: 716b70b, a02f7aa, 623819c, 7366ac3, 8844684
**Details**:
- **Root Cause**: During Flutter migration, project was restructured into monorepo with `backend/` and `mobile/` directories, but Railway deployment configuration wasn't updated to reflect new structure
- **Solution**: Created root-level `package.json` with npm workspaces that delegates all commands to backend directory
- Created `nixpacks.toml`, `build.sh`, and `start.sh` for Nixpacks configuration
- Updated `backend/tsconfig.json` to exclude test files from production builds
- When Railway runs `npm install && npm run build`, it now properly executes:
  - `cd backend && npm install`
  - `cd backend && npm run build`
- Successfully tested locally and pushed to trigger Railway rebuild
- **Note**: GitHub-triggered deployments work correctly. Railway CLI (`railway up`) bypasses config files and should be avoided for this monorepo setup
- **Also Fixed**: Removed 1,688 node_modules files (664k lines) from git tracking - they were accidentally committed before .gitignore was properly configured
